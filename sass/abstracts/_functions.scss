/*Functions allow you to define complex operations on SassScript values that you can re-use throughout 
your stylesheet. They make it easy to abstract out common formulas and behaviors in a readable way.

Functions are defined using the @function at-rule, which is written:
 @function <name>(<arguments...>) { ... }. A functionâ€™s name can be any Sass identifier. 
 It can only contain universal statements, as well as the @return at-rule which indicates the 
 value to use as the result of the function call. Functions are called using the normal CSS 
 function syntax.

@function pow($base, $exponent) {
  $result: 1;
  @for $_ from 1 through $exponent {
    $result: $result * $base;
  }
  @return $result;
}

.sidebar {
  float: left;
  margin-left: pow(4, 3) * 1px;
}*/
